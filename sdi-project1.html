<p>In this assignment I chose the theme of a battle taking place between the player and a wolf.</p><p>I Chose this theme because of my affinity towards the RPG genre. Another reason I chose this as my theme is this is meant to be a direct reference to my game in development, being that the first enemies you encounter are wolves at very low levels.</article>
